Though theEU is increasing its share of global cleantech investment, an investment ""valley of death"" at regional level remains a stubborn challenge. Between one-off pilot demonstrators and large-scale renewable investment projects such off-shore wind parks, there is limited financial support or demonstrated partnership models for scaling mid-stage projects across Europe.
Backed by the European Union, 13 organisations have formed the BRAVE partnership to develop 7 regional public-private investment ecosystems across Northern Europe to break out of the cleantech pilot trap. Partners will trial new ways to scale cleantech solutions - with a focus on increasing ‘business readiness’ in the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, France, and Sweden, and Germany
With support from professional finance experts, BRAVE partners will define their scale-up challenges, identify effective models for public-private partnerships, and design novel business and investment models between public authorities and private energy investors that can de-risk in Europe’s local energy sector.

Many cities and regions have set ambitious goals to make public planning and construction (PPC) processes more circular, reducing waste, reusing materials, and extending building lifecycles.However, these circular processes often remain inefficient, difficult to upscale, and hard to replicate. Challenges include siloed administrative structures, lack of digital data and know-how, and rigid procurement and planning regulations that leave little room for innovation and sustainable practices.Building Information Management (BIM)has the potential to transform this situation by enabling structured information flows, cross-sector collaboration, and transparent tracking of materials and building components across the entire lifecycle.

We keep profits in the region and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.ImageMain contentWhy do we work on collective and cooperative aquathermal energy?A huge share of final energy consumption in the European Union is used for space heating and cooling. Until now, we use fossil fuels to do this. This presents us with an enormous challenge to find alternatives.The use of renewable energy sources, including aquathermal energy, can help reduce the use of fossil fuels.Aquathermal energy is a very efficient form of heating and cooling and does not need a lot of scarce materials. Aquathermal energy solutions have many benefits:• Less carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions• Reduction of air pollution• Less dependence on energy imports• More efficient use of energy and raw materialsThe use of AE and other renewable energy sources offers local energy cooperatives the opportunity to generate and supply their own energy. In addition to climate benefits, this has other benefits, such as stimulating local economic activities, retaining income in the region and contributing to a fair and inclusive transition to sustainable energy.What is our work plan to achieve our goal?WaterWarmth consists of 6 different tracks. This 6 tracks provide a holistic approach to aquathermal energy, ranging from methodologies to estimate aquathermal energy potential, to market potential of aquathermal energy and the best-suited governance arrangements for energy communities. Our outputs can be scaled-up and replicated by other energy communitiesTrack 1: wants to share the possibilities of Aquathermie and make people aware of this clean way of generating energy.Track 2: by testing in 5 test setups we show how renewable energy (Aquathermal) can be used in different situations.Track 3: We want to develop large-scale implementation. During the WaterWarmth project, 3 to 4 major collaborative projects will be developed for the use of renewable energy.Track 4: we are working on gathering knowledge about how we can integrate renewable energy into local energy networks.Track 5: We investigate how aquathermal energy (AE) can position itself in the market. How can it impact energy security and independence.Track 6: We want to create frameworks for analyzing the current way of governance (regulation), policy and stakeholder involvement.The outputs and results from these 6 tracks will support energy cooperatives in the transition to sustainable energy.More about usWhich long-term results do we envision for the region?We create a strategy to identify areas where aquathermal systems can provide a viable solution for the energy transitionWe bolster European and national support for regional and local authorities that facilitate energy communities.We develop a strategy for strengthening local energy security and independence.We create an action plan for utilizing the economic potential of aquathermal energy aimed at energy communities.We take an European approach to develop an action plan that can continue AE heating and cooling in an international setting.We will develop a roadmap for collective AE systems for energy communities.brochure project overviewbrochure project overview",

Growing demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and electrified heating and cooling is putting unprecedented stress on Europe’s local electricity grids. Add rooftop solar panels with less reliable patterns of generation, and managing these new pressures becomes a city-wide conern. Without action, local authorities could soon be forced to delay or deny plans for new homes, warehouses, shops, hospitals, schools or EV chargers as the grid struggles to cope.Achieving a smooth local energy transition means local authorities must take on new planning and action responsibilities to build a strong and reliable local energy system.

Bremen is lead beneficiary in this project, responsible for project management, reporting and organising joint events and workshops. Bremen collaborates with Mpact to coordinate high-impact and high-quality communication activities and provide a harmonised communication strategy across the project partnership. Bremen will be one of the main policy creators and influencers in the project, will carry out living lab implementations and assess the long-term impact of mobility management measures in real-estate development policies and their uptake among citizens. Bremen will also establish a transferable training programme for real-estate developers and planners on how to effectively implement shared mobility and sustainable travel modes into new developments, in order to have a long-lasting impact on reducing car-ownership and car dependency.
The GEWOBA's role in the project is to implement mobility management measures in new and existing real estate development projects (including a mobility hub, bicycle repair shop, carsharing station, bike and cargo bike sharing as well as soft measures such a user group oriented communication for renters and buyers, providing carsharing memberships and supporting the use of other forms of shared transport). The GEWOBA's activities represent the living lab side of the new policy implementations of the City of Bremen. The organisation works closely with the City's Transport and Development departments in a knowledge exchange that allows the improvement of procedures not only within the approval process but also implementation process.
Lund University is a full partner in the project and the tasks within the project are to contribute with research and act as advisor to project-partner cities and other project partners on sustainable mobility, urban natural ecosystem services and other issues related to urban values and sustainable urban space solutions, also in new housing developments and in densified city areas. LU is responsible for monitoring and providing impact assessment tasks in the project, particularly of the implemented pilot and living labs solutions. LU also builds up new research competence at the University, and creates a research basis for higher education in relation to e.g. sustainable mobility, natural ecosystem services and new sustainable mobility strategies for new housing development areas as well as contributing to creating new academic research platforms.
The City of Aarhus is the facilitator of and provides the planning framework for sustainable urban mobility housing developments. The project is a showcase on how public authorities and private developers can work together on a common goal of sustainable mobility oriented development. The City acts as both the authority, but also as mobility manager and sparring partner for the private developer, and ensures that the implemented measures will be evaluated and assessed according to the standard of the project. The knowledge the City gains from participating in the project will both be in terms of new ways of collaboration and in terms of demonstrating impact on the modal share in the chosen urban development area.
Shared mobility falls in between public and private sector and requires collaborative action for success. AM develops governance structures that can help to further shared mobility in urban building sites (e.g. at the pilot site Merwede in Utrecht) from the perspective of a real-estate developer. AM brings a private sector perspective into the project as a housing developer with experience in the mobility market as well – this is a rare perspective that is beneficial for the other housing and real-estate developers as well as providing insight for the public sector partners. The pilots and activities implemented by AM attempt to answer many questions around long-term business cases of shared mobility and the required scope for future-proof and adaptive policy frameworks.
The City of Stavanger carries out one of the living lab sites in the project. A particular focus lies on one development area where houses, streets and infrastructure are built next to the future third largest mobility hub in the region. The area is called Jåtun. Stavanger shares its challenges with the project partners with the aim for developing better solutions for the City. The City collaborates with and exchanges experience with relevant stakeholders such as planners, developers and research institutes. Stavanger has a special interest in exploring how to increase the proportion of shared transport and works on solutions regarding ""Living as a Service"", a holistic approach in housing developments that focuses on mobility as well as other shared residential services (tool, appliances, shared infrastructure).
Together with Lund University, UGE is of valuable assistance in understanding city policies that link parking, shared modes and housing. UGEparticipates in bibliographic research, in the analysis of other cities' experiences and in the establishment of states of the art, particularlywith respect to parking standards for housing developments in cities across Europe. This is a comparison that cities are frequently seekingbut that does not exist to date. UGE also works together with Lund University to develop methods of impact assessment (find relevantindicators, monitoring them) of the pilots and living labs implemented in the project. It also suggests improvements andrecommendations to help partner cities achieve better results in line with their objectives. UGE helps to disseminate the project byparticipating in seminars, conferences and congresses and by publishing reports and academic papers and integrating lessons learnedinto its own teaching curriculum.
Together with Woonpunt, the City implements pilots in three areas and assesses the impact of shared mobility management measures targeting social housing in particular. In general, this target group has less access to shared mobility due to financial or other barriers such as lack of awareness, lack of knowledge, language problems, etc. Mechelen aims to raise awareness among this target group, develop tailored support measures and test them in living labs, the results of which will be transferable to other cities. In collaboration with housing developers, Mechelen develops new housing mobility management concepts facilitating shared mobility, reducing car parks and implementing shared mobility services.
The main role of Housing Europe in this project is wide-scale knowledge transfer from the mobility field to the social housing sector and it members across Europe. The dissemination of lessons learned on mobility and parking policies as well as shared mobility services to and through the engagement with social housing providers is Housing Europe’s mission in the project. Housing Europe also develops policy recommendations for this target group, assists in the testing and validation of approaches and ideas that will be developed in the living labs and fosters the replication of innovative approaches in additional social housing districts.

Way To Go is an authority on advising municipalities and real estate developers on how to integrate shared mobility into municipal building codes, how to implement these services in this context to maximise user acceptance as well as maximise the reduction of cars owned and parking spaces required. The organisation supports local authorities in Belgium in setting up action plans on shared mobility.Way To Go focuses on developing useful tools that are essential for integrating shared mobility into housing developments such as a method to determine a concrete replacing ratio of private cars when implementing carsharing and an evaluations standard in order to measure the real impact on car ownership and the modal shift of carsharing. Way To Go also sets up several living labs for creating awareness for shared mobility among people living in new housing developments. Together with the neighbourhood, they determine what is needed in order to live with fewer private cars. Way To Go also provides policy recommendations and tips and tricks for local governments, providers of shared mobility and planners. Not only to integrate shared mobility, but also to make a success story of it.WebsiteCity of Helsingborg (SE)The City of Helsingborg is the local authority for spatial and transport planning. Helsingborg brings expertise in operational and strategic traffic planning and has experience and knowledge in areas such as parking, cycling and deliveries. One of the most important goals is to find a holistic (circular economy) solution for urban mobility including the whole process from how energy is created and distributed to the people of the City who have a need for transportation. Helsingborg has three new development areas where the City is implementing multimodal urban mobility including shared modes.The City of Helsingborg is one of the many living lab sites in the project and has several activities that are relevant for this project. A particular focus lies on on three development areas where houses, streets and infrastructure are built with multimodal transportation and shared mobility as one major focus. The areas are: Mariastaden (semi-rural area to the city), Östra Ramlösa (new development area in the city) and Oceanhamnen (in the city centre adjacent to the central station and bordering to the ocean). Helsingborg has a special interest in exploring how to increase the proportion of shared transport.WebsiteImageLund University (SE)The Environmental Strategy, Department of Service Management and Service Studies, ISM, at Lund University has competencies in sustainable urban planning and development of new housing areas, climate change aspects and CO2 budgets, sustainable and shared mobility, urban natural ecosystem services and the value of shared public space, production and use of renewable and sustainable fuels, the climate change challenge linked to urban planning, sustainable business trips and local bicycle strategies, pedagogical aspects of reduced energy demands, etc.Lund University is a full partner in the project and the tasks within the project are to contribute with research and act as advisor to project-partner cities and other project partners on sustainable mobility, urban natural ecosystem services and other issues related to urban values and sustainable urban space solutions, also in new housing developments and in densified city areas. LU is responsible for monitoring and providing impact assessment tasks in the project, particularly of the implemented pilot and living labs solutions. LU also builds up new research competence at the University, and creates a research basis for higher education in relation to e.g. sustainable mobility, natural ecosystem services and new sustainable mobility strategies for new housing development areas as well as contributing to creating new academic research platforms.WebsiteImageCity of Aarhus (DK)The Aarhus municipal department of mobility is responsible for all aspects of the spatial planning of infrastructure and mobility in new development areas. Over the last couple of years, the responsibility for the green transition of the transport sector towards a carbon neutral society by 2030 has also been allocated to the mobility department. This has led to an increased focus and increased competencies in green urban mobility planning, competencies that can be used in this project. Aarhus simply needs to connect the dots between urban development and mobility and practice in understanding which urban development mechanisms and services that can support the target of carbon neutrality.The City of Aarhus is the facilitator of and provides the planning framework for sustainable urban mobility housing developments. The project is a showcase on how public authorities and private developers can work together on a common goal of sustainable mobility oriented development. The City acts as both the authority, but also as mobility manager and sparring partner for the private developer, and ensures that the implemented measures will be evaluated and assessed according to the standard of the project. The knowledge the City gains from participating in the project will both be in terms of new ways of collaboration and in terms of demonstrating impact on the modal share in the chosen urban development area.WebsiteImageCity of Utrecht (NL)With Utrecht’s strategy “Healthy Urban Living for Everyone”, the City places health at the centre of urban development by weighing all decisions with regard to their impact on every citizens' wellbeing. In addition, the “Mobility Plan 2040” aims for zero growth in car traffic and to be the Cycling City of Europe. The City is growing fast; space has to be used efficiently, so shared mobility is very important. Utrecht has many innovative and best practices to share on sustainable shared mobility, such as progressive projects like the MaaS App ""Gaiyo"", the development of shared mobility hubs and Coding the Curbs with its smart organised multifunctional use of space. Utrecht has ambitious plans to scale up (necessary due to the high growth), however, it also creates (un)foreseen issues within the context of urban (re)development in higher density areas, like to accessibility of shared mobility for each citizen, especially low income groups.Inclusivity is given priority in the ‘Mobility Plan 2040’ where citizen with a lower income or distance from the labour market should also be given the opportunity to use shared mobility. Affordability and lack of understanding of shared mobility is one of the issues why these people do not use these mobility services. Although large urban development projects included shared mobility in their concepts, these are struggling between matching a (commercial) offer and possibilities of lower income groups. In this project, Utrecht aims to make shared mobility more accessible and affordable for low-income target groups within urban development projects by implementing practical living labs and suitable policy frameworks to support this. Utrecht also researches and designs a better policy framework that sets the necessary requirements to organise and finance a shared mobility management solution for lower income citizens in urban (re)development projects on a futureproof manner.WebsiteImageAM (NL)AM is a district developer based in the Netherlands and mostly active in cities and urban regions in the Netherlands. The housing shortage combined with the sustainable mobility challenge requires new solutions to decrease car ownership and usage. Based on thorough research on shared mobility in newly built housing areas, AM created a sustainable mobility approach which the developer now implements in 22 projects with four mobility hubs. However, AM acknowledges that the upscaling and long-term effectiveness of new (shared) mobility solutions requires a more integral approach, policy innovation and smarter solutions.Shared mobility falls in between public and private sector and requires collaborative action for success. AM develops governance structures that can help to further shared mobility in urban building sites (e.g. at the pilot site Merwede in Utrecht) from the perspective of a real-estate developer. AM brings a private sector perspective into the project as a housing developer with experience in the mobility market as well – this is a rare perspective that is beneficial for the other housing and real-estate developers as well as providing insight for the public sector partners. The pilots and activities implemented by AM attempt to answer many questions around long-term business cases of shared mobility and the required scope for future-proof and adaptive policy frameworks.WebsiteImageCity of Stavanger (NO)The spatial plan for the City of Stavanger emphasises developing a city of short distances. The goals are to reduce the need for transport, the dependency on car use and reduce emissions from transport. The sustainable mobility planning strategy emphasises facilitating walking, cycling and public transport. Shared mobility and cooperation with developers and mobility service providers is a soft part of the strategy. Since 2009, the City requires mobility plans for new real-estate developments at different stages in the planning process. The mobility plans merge hard and soft measures. The City is responsible for creating and implementing sustainable planning policies as well as guiding real-estate developers on the need to plan more resource and space efficiently. Stavanger is also a ""smart city"" and was the first municipality in Norway to adopt a local road map for the smart City of Stavanger in 2016.The City of Stavanger carries out one of the living lab sites in the project. A particular focus lies on one development area where houses, streets and infrastructure are built next to the future third largest mobility hub in the region. The area is called Jåtun. Stavanger shares its challenges with the project partners with the aim for developing better solutions for the City. The City collaborates with and exchanges experience with relevant stakeholders such as planners, developers and research institutes. Stavanger has a special interest in exploring how to increase the proportion of shared transport and works on solutions regarding ""Living as a Service"", a holistic approach in housing developments that focuses on mobility as well as other shared residential services (tool, appliances, shared infrastructure).WebsiteImageKolumbus (NO)Kolumbus is the public transport provider in Rogaland County and the City of Stavanger. Kolumbus is also described as being one of the most innovative public transport authorities in the world with their approach as a holistic mobility service provider. They provide services with city e-bikes, carsharing, e-scooters, autonomous buses, electric boats, in addition to more traditional services like bus, boat and train. Kolumbus also has a strong focus on B2B (Business-to-Business services) with their own B2B-concept called ""HomeWorkHome"". Kolumbus also plays a role in many of the City of Stavanger's development projects and mobility concepts for new real-estate sites.Kolumbus is the mobility provider in the living labs that are implemented in Stavanger during the project. Kolumbus brings the unique insights of a (shared) mobility service provider into the project, not only from a sense of how to implement municipal policies in a practical setting but also in order to provide insights into the business case needed for shared mobility services such shared (e-)bikes, carsharing, e-scooters, particularly in connection with more traditional services like bus, boat and train.WebsiteImageGustave Eiffel University (FR)In January 2022, the l'Université Paris-Est Marne-la-Vallée UPEM) and the l’ Institut français des sciences et technologies des transports, de l'aménagement et des réseaux (IFSTTAR) merged under the new entity University Gustave Eiffel (UGE) which is located in the North Sea Region near Lille, France. The institutions are sharing teaching and research activities. UPEM is an interdisciplinary university with 12 faculties and 15 research centres. In particular, the department for Cities, Mobility and Transport (LVMT) addresses areas such as urban multimodal transport or the interactions between city residents and transportation. IFSTTAR is a major player in European research on cities and territories, transport and civil engineering. The researchers contribute to the emergence of energy-efficient, safe and reasoned solutions to meet society's expectations by participating in the design of reliable transport systems adapted to all people and goods.Together with Lund University, UGE is of valuable assistance in understanding city policies that link parking, shared modes and housing. UGEparticipates in bibliographic research, in the analysis of other cities' experiences and in the establishment of states of the art, particularlywith respect to parking standards for housing developments in cities across Europe. This is a comparison that cities are frequently seekingbut that does not exist to date. UGE also works together with Lund University to develop methods of impact assessment (find relevantindicators, monitoring them) of the pilots and living labs implemented in the project. It also suggests improvements andrecommendations to help partner cities achieve better results in line with their objectives. UGE helps to disseminate the project byparticipating in seminars, conferences and congresses and by publishing reports and academic papers and integrating lessons learnedinto its own teaching curriculum.WebsiteImageCity of Mechelen (BE)The City of Mechelen’s Strategy and Development department is responsible for a wide range of topics, from Mobility and Transport to Sustainability and Urban Development. The City’s Mobility Plan pays particular attention to cycling and shared mobility. By actively boosting sharing systems and expanding both supply and quality, also in areas that are commercially less interesting for providers, shared mobility becomes a high-performance system that can compete with other means of transport. The City already provides a clear framework for shared mobility in the public domain and has quite an innovative approach to shared mobility integration into real-estate developments: the parking standards for new buildings are lowered when developers invest in shared mobility. The City serves as a lighthouse example on how to strategically promote and integrate shared mobility into a variety of settings and a variety of modes, including carsharing, bikesharing and shared cargo bikes.Together with Woonpunt, the City implements pilots in three areas and assesses the impact of shared mobility management measures targeting social housing in particular. In general, this target group has less access to shared mobility due to financial or other barriers such as lack of awareness, lack of knowledge, language problems, etc. Mechelen aims to raise awareness among this target group, develop tailored support measures and test them in living labs, the results of which will be transferable to other cities. In collaboration with housing developers, Mechelen develops new housing mobility management concepts facilitating shared mobility, reducing car parks and implementing shared mobility services.WebsiteImageWoonland (BE)Woonland is a public social housing company in the Flemish region of Mechelen. Woonland rents and sells sustainable and affordable housing to the most vulnerable people and has 3000 homes in its jurisdiction. Woonland has an excellent network and can act as a link to the target group. Through this project, Woonland wishes to strengthen its objective of corporate social responsibility and find innovative ways of incorporating shared mobility into its development sites to make it more accessible to vulnerable citizens as well use it to reduce car dependency and space consumption.Together with the City of Mechelen, Woonland implements pilots in three areas and assesses the impact of shared mobility management measures targeting social housing in particular. In general, this target group has less access to shared mobility due to financial or other barriers such as lack of awareness, lack of knowledge, language problems or many other. Woonland aims to raise awareness among this target group, develop and test tailored support measures in living labs.WebsiteImageHousing Europe (BE)Housing Europe is the European Federation of Public, Cooperative and Social Housing. Established in 1988, it is a network of 46 national and regional federations, which together gather about 43,000 public, social and cooperative housing providers in 25 countries. Altogether, they manage around 25 million homes. Housing Europe and its network of housing providers have a vision of a Europe, which provides access to decent and affordable housing for all in communities which are socially, economically and environmentally sustainable and where everyone is enabled to reach their full potential.The main role of Housing Europe in this project is wide-scale knowledge transfer from the mobility field to the social housing sector and it members across Europe. The dissemination of lessons learned on mobility and parking policies as well as shared mobility services to and through the engagement with social housing providers is Housing Europe’s mission in the project. Housing Europe also develops policy recommendations for this target group, assists in the testing and validation of approaches and ideas that will be developed in the living labs and fosters the replication of innovative approaches in additional social housing districts.WebsiteImageMeet the SN² team!Remote video URL",

MegaBITS will take this one step further.Below is further information about the MegaBITS project.Bicycle PyramidDerived from the Maslow’s hierarchy of needs (Maslow Pyramid) and Herzberg’s Two-factor theory, the Province of Overijssel has developed a similar hierarchy of needs for cyclists, showing the factors influencing modal shift from car to bike (figure below).ImageFirstly, cycling has to be safe and reliable, secondly it should be (relatively) fast and convenient (clear routes, easy bicycle parking, etc). Once these levels have been matched, comfort and user experience become important.The Bicycle Pyramid forms the basis of the MegaBITS proposal, where the seven cities and regions have different levels of bicycle infrastructure, bicycle use and bicycle policy. Each demonstration site will have different priorities on the Bicycle Pyramid and therefore a different focus of their flagship.FlagshipsThe MegaBITS project has defined 5 flagships, divided across 7 cities/regions. Each flagship has its own flagship theme, i.e.Smart cycling corridor (Province of Overijssel, City of Zwolle, City of Enschede)Smart traffic management for cyclists (City of Copenhagen)Digitizing urban cycling (City of Hamburg)Smart data fusion (Province of Antwerp)Smart cycling management (Le Havre Seine Métropole).Each flagship consists of a number of coherent ITS projects focused on improving the cycling conditions with respect to i) safety & reliability, ii) speed & ease of use, iii) comfort & experience. At the same time these ITS implementations for cyclists provide iv) data to the CycleDataHub and v) products, services and knowledge to the Bicycles and ITS Directory. This is shown graphically in the figure below.ImageEach flagship consists of a number of coherent ITS implementations for cyclists, which jointly will create an ecosystem that contributes to the overall flagship theme.

Previous floods have shown that the impact of floods is unknown to relevant stakeholders, and evacuation options are not well identified nor implemented. Therefore, proactive action is needed.ImageMain contentProject content and objectivesTime for actionFor many years the prevailing belief was that flood risks can only be diminished by dikes and other spatial adaptation measures. However,NSR projects such as FRAMES,show that these measures are not sufficient in the near future to protect against extreme flooding events, which are becoming more and more prevalent because of climate change. It is therefore urgent to improve crisis management and recovery for climate-related floods. For example, the impact of a flood is often not known by local authorities, emergency services and residents, and evacuation options are not adequately identified nor implemented. Floods such as those in summer 2021 in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany further prove the need to improve crisis management and recovery measures.To improve, organisations active in crisis management face two challenges. Firstly, the flood perception and the self-efficacy of citizens, politicians and organisations are low, leading to insufficient capacity and preparedness to act. Secondly, climate crises are often not considered in evacuation planning, and there is little consideration for long-term resilience during post-flood recovery.ApproachIn response to these challenges, ten partners from the North Sea Region have teamed-up and established FIER, a project focused on four key areas: Flooding, Infrastructure, Evacuation, and Resilience. The aim is to enhance societal resilience and minimise the impact of flood crises. This is done by developing and implementing new approaches and routines for crises management organisations to act before, during and after floods, focusing on behavioural change and improved infrastructure.Three objectives have been defined that the project specifically focus on:Raise awareness and promote self-efficacy for climate-induced flood crises among local authorities and societyImprove the emergency response of crisis managing organisations to prepare and act during a climate-induced flood crisisEnhancing capacities for resilient recovery after climate-induced floodsImageTeam and partnersThe project consortium consists of 10 partners from 5 different countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands and Sweden) with diverse backgrounds ranging from government agencies to universities.  The partners are:Provincie ZeelandVeiligheidsregio ZeelandJade Hochschule Wilhelmshaven/Oldenburg/ElsflethFederale Dienst Gouverneur Oost-Vlaanderen – Dienst NoodplanningTorsby KommunFederale Diensten Gouverneur West-Vlaanderen, Dienst NoodplanningKarlstads universitetGemeente DordrechtSyndicat mixte pour le schema d'aménagement et de gestion des eaux du Boilonnais (SYMSAGEB)BUILDERS Ecole d'ingénieursRead more about our partnersGet in touch with our partners",

So organisations, be it nature conservationists or jurisdictions, can inquire how light pollution is evolving on a local scale.","Partner Information:
In order to battle light pollution, it is absolutely essential that we monitor it. In that way, policy can be made, and progress can be tracked. Since 2011, the VIIRS instrument on the SUOMI satellite has been monitoring our planet, providing daily light pollution maps. However, due to for instance weather effects, they are not precise at low levels. Moreover, the maps do not measure in, for example, blue light wavelengths, which happens to be a wavelength range of increasing concern due to the use of LED lighting. The KID monitoring system aims to address the shortcomings of simply relying on satellite data. Our robust light pollution monitoring system is envisioned to accurately keep track of the total amount of light at night, but also measure factors such as the colour of the light and light near the horizon. The team behind KID seeks to find the best combination of a diversity of techniques, using ground-based instrumentation next to satellite data.
We want to set up detector stations in bright and dark locations, scattered across the Wadden Sea area, crossing the borders of the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. Please refer to our 'Detectors' section for more information on the measuring equipment we use for our pilot sites. Our stations for instance make use of SQMs (Sky Quality Meters), devices which measure the brightness of the night sky in green wavelengths, every minute. The partners have constructed a network (washetdonker.nl) where the data from these devices is displayed for the public to see. Wide-field cameras are also used, taking images of the entire sky every couple of minutes in the red, green, and blue wavelength bands of light. KID members analyse the obtained data and compare the many different detectors to substantiate the reliability of the measurements and create the sturdy light pollution monitoring network that we are after.

This small-scale project seeks to develop a monitoring network to reliably measure light pollution, so to address the current lack of a sound methodology to track the pollution trends accurately. The project is focused specifically on analysing Artificial Light at Night (ALAN) in the Wadden Sea area. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is one of the darkest regions in Europe, but like many such places, it is increasingly affected by light.ImageLight as a PollutantIn short, light pollution refers to excessive or improperly directed artificial light, which is produced by humans, and which disrupts the natural darkness of the night. Mankind has been using various forms of artificial light for centuries on end. Think of the discovery of fire by early humans, and the creation of candles and oil lamps by ancient civilisations. A significant increase in the intensity and prevalence of ALAN began during the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the advent of electric lighting. The world witnessed rapid urbanisation and industrialisation, which brought more and more light along with it. Advancements in lighting technology, particularly the widespread adoption of fluorescent and later, LED lighting, further intensified the issue of light pollution. These sources of light might be more energy-efficient but often also produce more intense light, contributing increasingly to skyglow, causing the night sky's natural darkness to be compromised.As globalisation accelerated, the trouble of light pollution spread further and further across our planet. The expansion of outdoor (and indoor) lighting - like streetlights, agricultural greenhouses, factories, offices, sporting venues, illuminated advertisements, and aesthetic lighting - has numerous advantages and has drastically changed the way we live, work, and communicate. However, it can simply not only be seen as a matter of progress.The Dead of NightThe rise of ALAN moved quickly; gradually, but swiftly. This made it somewhat difficult for people to realise just how much brighter the world was becoming. Only in recent decades has there been a growing awareness of the numerous impacts of light pollution. And there are many.For centuries, when one would look up to the night sky, one would have been overwhelmed by countless little dots of light, sparkling in the darkness of the night.Our ancestors looked up to the night sky with admiration, fascination, and a seemingly intrinsic desire to know more. Today, we are not much different in that regard, but we have entered an era in which this deep-rooted inherent human curiosity is getting progressively harder to satisfy. Ground-based astronomical research and amateur stargazing - an attempt to push the boundaries of our knowledge and a way tomomentarily escape the hustle of daily existence - are being hit hard by our accustomed thirst for light. Take for example the Milky Way - our home; the galaxy in which we reside. From Earth, we see the Milky Way as a band of faint light stretching across the night sky. Unfortunately, this is no longer something for everyone to enjoy. About a third of the world's population no longer sees this phenomenon appear at night at all, and about 60% of Europeans have lost sight of our own galaxy entirely.Next to this, excessive exposure to artificial light at night also affects our wellbeing. Our biological clock, a resilient system in sync with the natural rhythm of day and night, that has evolved over millions of years, governs sleep-wake cycles, hormone regulation, and various physiological functions. With the rise of light pollution, our circadian rhythms are disturbed as ALAN interferes with the production of melatonin. This may lead to sleep loss or even insomnia, diminished sleep quality, potential health issues, and a negative impact on daily activities.But, we are not the only ones impacted. The nature surrounding us is also deeply connected with the daily cycle of day and night. The disturbance thereof affects every organism, animal or plant, differently. For instance, there are plants that only open up their flowers when it is dark so they can be pollinated by insects, which now happens less frequently. Certain insect species are misled by artificial light, so they deposit their eggs on surfaces like asphalt instead of water, where the eggs cannot hatch. Toads postpone their migration. Bats avoid areas with light and thus their habitats are becoming severely limited. Consider migratory birds as well. They navigate partly based on the light of stars and the moon, and light pollution causes disorientation. Birds become trapped in ALAN, losing their ability to use their regular navigation methods completely. This can have severe consequences, such as losing their way entirely, being unable to find food and a resting place, leading to exhaustion and possibly death. It can affect individuals, but also entire populations, disrupting entire ecological balances. This is also a significant concern for the Wadden Sea region, a transit point for many migratory birds.Keeping tabs on Light PollutionSo, rather recently, people started looking into ways of restoring more of the natural darkness of the night. We can work on solutions so that less unused light shines needlessly into the atmosphere. Such as the better bundling and directing of streetlights, using less intense lights where possible, or making more use of lighting based on movement sensors, just to give some examples. All in all, to combat light pollution and really make a stand for a darker night sky, light pollution considerations need to be included in local and national legislation, encouraging responsible lighting practices. But in order to achieve something like this, we are in need of a way of accurately and reliably measuring light pollution. This is were KID comes in. We want to develop a system doing exactly that.ImageKID (Keep it Dark)In order to battle light pollution, it is absolutely essential that we monitor it.

So organisations, be it nature conservationists or jurisdictions, can inquire how light pollution is evolving on a local scale.Research in the Wadden Sea regionThe UNESCO World Heritage site is a perfect region to work in to construct our measuring system. Why? It stretches over diverse landscapes, encompassing a blend of rural and urban areas, agricultural expanses, and industrial zones. Besides, the site spans across various local, regional, and national administrative jurisdictions, providing a comprehensive canvas for studying the tracking of light pollution. The efforts and insights derived from KID's initiatives are envisioned to eventually extend beyond the boundaries of the Wadden Sea area, contributing valuable knowledge and practical approaches to addressing light pollution to various other corners of the world.EURODARK 2024All of the findings of the KID project will be presented at the EURODARK conference, the 16thEuropean Symposium for the Protection of the Night Sky, in March 2024, to be held in Groningen, the Netherlands.ImageProject FactsInterreg North Sea Small Project - Programme Priority 3 ‘A Climate Resilient North Sea Region’Project period: 2022-2024 (18 months in total)Project budget: € 462,499 (€ 277,499 granted by ERDF)Project Partners:University of Groningen (the Netherlands, lead partner)Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg (Germany)Aarhus University (Denmark)",

The project is led by EV ILVO in Belgium, and involves partners RBINS, POM West-Vlaanderen, Antwerp University (Belgium), SINTEF Ocean (Norway), DTU Wind (Denmark), NIOZ (The Netherlands), Ifremer (France), BSH, Hereon and TU Braunschweig (Germany). Within the project, we also foresee a strong collaboration with different actors from industry, policy and the public sector.
ILVO will coordinate the Anemoi project. Through its role as coordinator, ILVO will be responsible for project management, including scientific and financial reporting, and for project communication and dissemination. ILVO will also have a major role in stakeholder engagement, supporting project partners SINTEF and POM West-Vlaanderen.
Within the Anemoi project, the institute is mainly involved WP2 which it is co-leading together with IFREMER. The Institute of Natural Sciences contributes to the sampling at OWFs with the RV Belgica, for which a dedicated sampling plan was elaborated. Further, the institute is responsible for analysing paint/coating particles extracted from sediment, using FTIR (and partially Raman). Therefore, it works in close collaboration with Hereon, analysing in seawater, and BSH adopting another identification method.
POM West Flanders (POM-WVL) is a regional development agency in Belgium developing a sustainable and innovative economy in West Flanders by promoting partnerships between industry & SMEs, knowledge institutions, the public sector and the general public (in a quadruple-helix approach). Five cluster policies are being implemented, in alignment with regional, national and European strategies. One of these covers the Blue Energy sector, comprising of offshore clean energy, green hydrogen and a range of hybrid solutions (multi-use and multi-source applications in a marine environment), and materials development and innovation for offshore applications.
POM-WVL is an active partner in the Anemoi project and contributes with the its competences and experience in innovation acceleration, facilitating clean offshore energy development and making available an advanced offshore test facility. Another important activity is to deepen the engagement with the broader sectors in the blue economy, such as the fishery, the ports, transport, coastal communities and tourism.
Participating in this project will result in collaborations with other European research groups. Additionally, it will  increase our knowledge on the effects of offshore wind farms on aquatic organisms. Finally it will result in multiple publications and in a PhD, which  will greatly contribute to the dissemination of the project outcomes.
In the ANEMOI project, SINTEF Ocean helps to design workshops and meetings that facilitate a sharing of knowledge between project partners and project stakeholders, who work in various capacities with chemical emissions from offshore wind farms.  SINTEF also contributes to WP2 of ANEMOI with non-target organic chemical analysis and characterisation of seawater leachates produced from a range of OWF infrastructure coatings.
Based on data derived from long-term monitoring, BSH has generated a huge data set on current concentrations of contaminants within the German EEZ and coastal areas. To gain more information on potential chemical emissions from corrosion protection systems of OWFs, BSH initiated the OffChEm I & II project in collaboration with the Helmholtz-Zentrum hereon in 2017. In these projects, suitable sampling strategies and analytical methods to determine chemical emissions from corrosion protection were developed, inorganic (harmful) substances were identified and their relevant influence on the local and regional marine environment was evaluated.
Within the Anemoi project, BSH has the lead for WP1 due to its experience on chemical emissions from OWFs as part of the issuing process in Germany. In collaboration with partners and national agencies, an overview on regulations with respect to chemical emissions from OWFs and a proposal for harmonization will be developed. In WP2, all sampling campaigns in the German North Sea will be conducted as part of the regular monitoring campaigns on BSH vessels. Furthermore, BSH is working in close collaboration with hereon and RBINS concerning the analysis of paint/coating particles in water and sediment. BSH will quantify particles in sediment samples using a Pyrolysis GC/MS approach. As part of WP1 and WP4, BSH will also support the collaboration with several stakeholders by holding one of the workshops and by taking on an advisory role.
LWI of TUB joins the consortium as an academic partner that brings expertise in engineering-focused assessment of fluid-structure interaction and associated processes in marine contexts. In Anemoi, we conduct numerical simulations to enhance the understanding of distribution processes of solute and solid chemical components in the marine realm. A second activity looks at the detachment, sinking and mixing processes of paint flakes in the vicinity of offshore wind structures.

Our main activities include effect assessment of a battery of test organisms on 1) leachates of paintings and galvanic anodes; here we explore the responses of the blue mussel by measuring the scope of growth and 2) the toxicity responses of different species exposed to whole sediments; i.e. an amphipod, a polychaete and early life stages of a marine fish species  and later, 3) mussels exposed in caged at the offshore windmill parks will be collected and scope for growth will be measured. At ECOSPHERE, we have a standing record of managing several EU co-funded  and other international projects such as:  (EU-PF7: ENNSATOX, PERFOOD); EU Interreg regional development funds: BERISP, Sullied Sediments; MSCA-ITN: INFLAME; JPI Oceans: EPHEMARE; CEFIC LRI: ECO20.2, ECO20-UA.Participating in this project will result in collaborations with other European research groups. Additionally, it will  increase our knowledge on the effects of offshore wind farms on aquatic organisms. Finally it will result in multiple publications and in a PhD, which  will greatly contribute to the dissemination of the project outcomes.Website UAImageVLAIO cofunded UA in the Anemoi projectNorwegian PartnerImageSINTEF OceanSINTEF Ocean, located in Norway, conducts research and innovation related to ocean space for national and international industries.

NIOZ will also implement these effects in a numerical biogeochemical ecosystem model to perform scenario studies to estimate potential exposure levels on filter-feeding organisms and secondary effects on the wider ecosystem induced by the resulting changes in filter feeder performance.Website NIOZFrench PartnerImageFrench National Institute for Ocean Science - IFREMERFrench leading institute in research, innovation and scientific policy support in marine science. The specific competencies gathered in IFREMER’s Research Unit on Chemical Contamination of the Marine Ecosystems (CCEM) are particularly relevant for the project. Some examples are the work on chemical contaminant (i.e. organic contaminants) dynamics in the marine environment and their transfer towards and into marine organisms and biological effects. These activities involve the development and implementation of trace/ultra-trace level analytical methods for contaminant quantification in key environmental compartments (e.g. sediment, water, organisms), the identification and quantification of spatial-temporal trends of chemical contamination and the study of bioaccumulation and biotransformation processes.IFREMER implication and work in ANEMOI will be done through CCEM Research Unit, as co-leader of WP2 (Mapping of chemical emissions). Involvement in WP3 (effects of chemical contaminants) is also foreseen.Website IfremerGerman PartnersImageFederal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of GermanyBSH is the central maritime authority in Germany supporting the blue economy, promoting the sustainable use of the ocean and observing the state of the seas. Services include forecasting currents and tides, water levels and storm surges, as well as observing sea ice, various pollutants and underwater noise, the state of sediments and the effects of climate change. Among others, BSH operates the marine environmental monitoring network MARNET in the German Bight and the western Baltic Sea and is responsible for maritime spatial planning and for authorising the construction of offshore wind farms (OWFs), cables and pipelines within the German exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Hereby, a major goal is to work towards “zero emissions” in this spatial area.Based on data derived from long-term monitoring, BSH has generated a huge data set on current concentrations of contaminants within the German EEZ and coastal areas. To gain more information on potential chemical emissions from corrosion protection systems of OWFs, BSH initiated the OffChEm I & II project in collaboration with the Helmholtz-Zentrum hereon in 2017. In these projects, suitable sampling strategies and analytical methods to determine chemical emissions from corrosion protection were developed, inorganic (harmful) substances were identified and their relevant influence on the local and regional marine environment was evaluated.Within the Anemoi project, BSH has the lead for WP1 due to its experience on chemical emissions from OWFs as part of the issuing process in Germany. In collaboration with partners and national agencies, an overview on regulations with respect to chemical emissions from OWFs and a proposal for harmonization will be developed. In WP2, all sampling campaigns in the German North Sea will be conducted as part of the regular monitoring campaigns on BSH vessels. Furthermore, BSH is working in close collaboration with hereon and RBINS concerning the analysis of paint/coating particles in water and sediment. BSH will quantify particles in sediment samples using a Pyrolysis GC/MS approach. As part of WP1 and WP4, BSH will also support the collaboration with several stakeholders by holding one of the workshops and by taking on an advisory role.Website BSHImageHereonHereon is a member of the Helmholz Association, which consists of numerous research centers throughout Germany. The center focuses on research in earth and environment, particularly coastal systems, as well as materials sciences and information services. The Institute of Coastal Environmental Chemistry conducts research into novel and known pollutants, their sources, transport pathways via the coasts, and their dispersal into the marine and polar environments. The infrastructure available within the Institute is enables analysis of classic and novel organic pollutants, plus to analyses of numerous elements, stable isotopes and radionuclides as well as microplastics and nanomaterials. Additionally, modeling of the behavior and fate of pollutants is conducted through numerous projects.The department of Inorganic Environmental Chemistry (KUA) is a member of the Anemoi project. The working group at Hereon uses modern chemical-analytical methods to investigate the occurrence, transport, fate, and effects of inorganic and novel particulate pollutants in coastal regions. Similar data have already been published via a number of projects, including theCoastal Pollution Toolbox. Within Anemoi, Hereon is responsible for the analysis of inorganic and particulate pollutants in environmental samples under WP2. The department brings experience in the topic from the OffChEm and OffChEm II projects (2017 – 2023) together with the German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH), which investigated chemical emissions from offshore wind in the German North Sea.Website HereonImageTechnische Universität BraunschweigTechnische Universität Braunschweig and its entity Leichtweiß-Institute for Hydraulic Engineering and Water Resources (LWI) have a longstanding research interest in offshore renewables. This is demonstrated through the joint operation of the Coastal Research Center in Hannover, Germany where engineering-focussed research on offshore renewables is a focal point. TU BS is also involved in research on energy storage, e.g. through low-head pumped storage applications along coastlines and in the ocean.LWI of TUB joins the consortium as an academic partner that brings expertise in engineering-focused assessment of fluid-structure interaction and associated processes in marine contexts.

Offering shore power to docked vessels reduces climate-disrupting pollutant emissions of diesel generators. The current approach to introduce shore power for inland shipping is fragmented and often country-specific, with insufficient competition, incomplete information, high transaction costs and the risk of a vendor lock in.SPIES brings stakeholders together to develop in co-creation a policy recommendation plan that will be delivered and introduced to policy levels to coordinate the roll out of shore power. Through cooperation and building on the results of existing initiatives, SPIES creates a uniform policy interoperability scheme which secures and promotes a fair and competitive shore power market and avoid too dominant market positions. SPIES will, moreover, lead to a network for the development of shore power facilities, policy advice, supported standards, policy objectives and a data protocol in line with the Fit for 55 objectives.Objectiveso Drawing up an inventory of shore power providerso Engage stakeholders and align market needso Draw up policy recommendationsOur mission statementSPIES improves the use on on-shore power supply (OPS) in European inland shipping by presenting a policy recommendation plan to key inland waterway transport (IWT) stakeholders, to ensure improved and open access to OPS for the European skippers in, and beyond the North Sea Region.",

EHRIN's transnational partnership gathered for the first time at the Provincie Drenthe in Assen in the summer of 2023.
EHRIN aims at strengthening cooperation governance for hydrogen development. EHRIN develops strategies in the setting of three concrete Hydrogen projects and in a transnational partnership.
In this Interreg North Sea project three partners found each other to work together, learn together and to set an example for other hydrogen developments. Read more about every partner and visit them digitaly following the text and links below.
The Province of Drenthe is located in the north-east of the Netherlands and we are the lead partners in the Ehrin project (Interreg North Sea Region Programme 2021-2027), which stands for Excellent Hydrogen Regions in Europe. The Province of Drenthe is part of the first Hydrogen Valley in Europe, a multi-stakeholder coalition which connects the entire hydrogen chain within the Northern-Netherlands.
The province of Drenthe will contribute to each activity of the partner regions along with the exchange of knowledge, communication and the dissemination of results, along with a pilot project for each partner region. Drenthe will aim to develop a hydrogen-powered train that crosses multiple borders from Emmen in Drenthe to Grafschaft Bentheim in Germany.
We have a common vision and ambition with our partners in the Ehrin project: to accelerate the transition to a hydrogen economy in the North Sea Region and beyond. We believe that hydrogen can play a key role in achieving the European Green Deal objectives and the Paris Agreement goals and create a more resilient energy system. We are committed to working together to overcome the challenges and barriers that hinder the development and deployment of hydrogen networks, such as high costs, lack of infrastructure, low awareness and skill-gaps. We are also eager to learn from each other and exchange best practices and experiences in the field of hydrogen.
