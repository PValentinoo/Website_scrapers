In Germany alone, digital health could save up to €35 billion each year. With Europe’s population ageing and chronic illnesses increasing, healthcare systems face unprecedented challenges. The solution? Innovative, cost-effective digital health strategies to keep quality care within reach.Enter DigiH4A: funded by the European Union’s Interreg North Sea programme, this initiative tackles two of the biggest hurdles in digital health—unlocking reimbursement pathways and building trust between healthcare providers and patients.ImageClearing the path to digital health integrationDigiH4A will collaborate with over 200 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to develop innovative reimbursement models and cost-benefit analysis methods.The project will also create astrategic action planto guide healthcare decision-makers, providers, and payers in seamlessly integrating digital health solutions into existing healthcare systems. This plan aims to enhance care delivery and improve patient outcomes by 2027.ImageUniting expertise for a healthier futureDigiH4A's partnership includes leading institutions such as Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences, the Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO), Karlstad University, and HAWK University of Applied Sciences, contributing valuable research and innovation expertise. Health authorities like Central Denmark Region and the Hamburg Ministry of Social Affairs will offer crucial insights into healthcare policy, while innovation actors, including lead partner Innovation Skåne, Sahlgrenska Science Park, Biotech Santé Bretagne, and Eurasanté, will facilitate the practical application of research outcomes.The project has received strong backing from prominent entities, including EIT Health, ARS Bretagne, the Danish Life Science Cluster, Euratechnologies, the Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority, and Leiden Municipality. These endorsements underscore DigiH4A's potential to drive meaningful change in healthcare across the North Sea region.By tackling systemic healthcare challenges on an international scale, DigiH4A is set to accelerate the digital transformation of health systems, benefiting citizens through improved access to cutting-edge digital health solutions."

For this to happen, investment is needed for energy projects of all sizes and maturity stages, from early stage demonstrations to full-scale deployment across Europe.Though theEU is increasing its share of global cleantech investment, an investment ""valley of death"" at regional level remains a stubborn challenge. Between one-off pilot demonstrators and large-scale renewable investment projects such off-shore wind parks, there is limited financial support or demonstrated partnership models for scaling mid-stage projects across Europe.Cleantech investments with ticket sizes of €10-100m are failing to attract capital beyond public subsidies. This leaves technologically mature innovations stuck in the ‘pilot trap’, unable to scale to regional or city level.ImageBRAVE brings together 13 frontrunners to build new regional investment ecosystemsBacked by the European Union, 13 organisations have formed the BRAVE partnership to develop 7 regional public-private investment ecosystems across Northern Europe to break out of the cleantech pilot trap. Partners will trial new ways to scale cleantech solutions - with a focus on increasing ‘business readiness’ in the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, France, and Sweden, and GermanyWith support from professional finance experts, BRAVE partners will define their scale-up challenges, identify effective models for public-private partnerships, and design novel business and investment models between public authorities and private energy investors that can de-risk in Europe’s local energy sector.ImageIn the next four years, BRAVE partners have committed to:Deliver seven regional ecosystemsin diverse energy domains, including low-carbon public mobility, residential solar, energy communities and industrial hydrogen hubsMobilise a combined €150min regional energy investments, crowding in public and private finance into the ‘missing middle’ of energy financeDevelop replicable business modelsand public-private partnership frameworks to accelerate cleantech uptake across EuropeCOPPER is an Interreg North Sea project co-funded by the European Union.Project start: July 2024Want to learn more?

From water management and biodiversity to mobility and housing – the question remains the same: how do you choose the right measures for a climate-resilient future? And how do you ensure that citizens are actively involved in these decisions?DISCO supports policymakers in tackling these complex challenges by strengthening their innovation power. DISCO encourages policymakers to discover the power of digital tools such as VR, digital twins, and smart visualizations, because these help provide a clear overview that enables decision-makers to make fair and effective choices. The partners within DISCO share their knowledge and successes with other decision-makers across the North Sea Region, accelerating the journey toward a safe and climate-resilient living environment for all.Eleven partnersfrom five countries participate in DISCO.Image"
